# Final Project 2025
**Topic: "Deep Learning-Based Drawing Analysis"**

## Introduction

Currently, in order to assess whether a child has dysgraphia, they are required to take a structured test where they replicate and draw images based on a variety of reference images they receive.

In this project, we have a dataset of approximately 5,000 images drawn by children based on a reference drawing. We have built a model that is capable of scoring each drawing on a scale from 1 to 7. This system aims to replace psychologists in determining whether a child is diagnosed with dysgraphia.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can analyze and score children's drawings based on their resemblance to reference images. The model will take an input image, compare it with a reference, and output a score that reflects the quality of the drawing.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of around 5,000 images of children's drawings, each created based on a reference image. The dataset includes images that vary in accuracy, quality, and detail, providing a comprehensive set for training and evaluation.

## Model

We have designed a deep learning model capable of scoring images on a scale from 1 to 7. The model leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to evaluate the resemblance between the children's drawings and the reference images.

## Objectives

- **Dysgraphia Detection:** To use the model to assess children's drawings and detect signs of dysgraphia.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model is trained to output a score between 1 and 7, where a higher score indicates a closer resemblance to the reference drawing.
